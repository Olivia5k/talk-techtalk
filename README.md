Hi everyone! My name is Lowe and I work in a cool tech company in Stockholm.
I work as a developer at a little place called Spotify, and I am here to talk
to you guys about why working with technology is awesome!

By now, you might be wondering why I am speaking English to you. I am from
Norrköping, so I speak Östgötska just fine. I speaking English partially to get
your attention, but mostly because that's exactly how we work. In my team of
seven people at Spotify, I am the only one from Sweden. Therefore, I speak
English at work everyday. Even when speaking to other Swedes, we usually speak
in English so that we don't exclude our non-Swedish colleagues. It's very nice,
and us Swedes don't have any problems with it since we are generally very good
at English. :)

Anyway, Spotify doesn't really need an introduction. We make sure that millions
of people around the world can listen to the music that they love, wherever
they are. To make sure that we can do that, we have over 6000 servers that do
everything from stream sound to your phones to try to figure out what a good
suggestion for new music for you could be. And, to write the code for those
things, we have 400 developers in Stockholm, and about a 100 more around the
world.

I personally handle the 100 or so computers that compile the code that
developers write into the programs that can run on your computers and phones.
So, whenever you see that yellow little bar on the top of Spotify that says
that there is a new version ready to be installed, I have been doing my job
well.

But enough about Spotify! I want to encourage you guys
